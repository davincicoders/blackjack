played casino games in the world.

The object of the game is to "beat the dealer",
which can be done in a number of ways:

* Get 21 points on your first two cards (called
  a blackjack), without a dealer blackjack

* Reach a final score higher than the dealer
  without exceeding 21

* Let the dealer draw additional cards until
  his hand exceeds 21.
